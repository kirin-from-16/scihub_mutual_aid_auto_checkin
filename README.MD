  - Set repetition if needed
- Click **OK** to save the trigger

### 5. Configure Actions

- Set "If the running task does not end when requested, force it to stop"
- Click **OK** to save the task

### 8. Provide Credentials

- When prompted, enter your Windows username and password
- These credentials are needed for the task to run when you're not logged in

## Troubleshooting

If your task isn't running as expected:

1. Check the task history in Task Scheduler
2. Verify that the paths in your batch file are correct
3. Ensure your script has proper error handling
4. Check the log files generated by your script
5. Try running the batch file manually to confirm it works

## Log Files

The script generates two log files:

- `smartquant_login.log`: Contains regular operation logs

- `smartquant_error.log`: Contains only error messages
